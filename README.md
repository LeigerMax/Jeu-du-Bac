## Rules Of The Game 
The baccalaureate game or bac game, more familiarly known as petit bac, is a board and word game whose goal is to find, in writing and with a limited number of moves, a series of words belonging to categories predefined by the players and beginning with the given letter.

The game will allow children to easily learn new names of capitals, animals, etc.

The goal? To get as many points as possible! Each correct answer is worth one point and sometimes bonuses between 1 and 20 points appear.

Do not put articles in front of the words "for example 'giraffe' instead of 'the giraffe*' ".

This game was programmed using **EduPython** and has not been tested during its development on other platforms.
 
With recent tests, I noticed that the **project does not work on a terminal**.
